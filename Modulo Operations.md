## What is modulo operation:

[GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/modulo-1097-1000000007/)

The remainder obtained after the division operation on two operands is known as modulo operation. Operator for doing modulus operation is ‘%’. For ex: a % b = c which means when a is divided by b it gives the remainder c, 7%2 = 1, 17%3 = 2.

### How modulo is used:
A few distributive properties of modulo are as follows:

1. ( a + b) % c = ( ( a % c ) + ( b % c ) ) % c
2. ( a * b) % c = ( ( a % c ) * ( b % c ) ) % c
3. ( a – b) % c = ( ( a % c ) – ( b % c ) ) % c

modulo is distributive over +, * and – but not over / [Please refer [Modular Division](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/modular-division/) for details]
